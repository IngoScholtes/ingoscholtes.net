                <p>Today, I feel feel very honored learning that Microsoft has just published a second themepack "Scenic Europe 2" that is dedicated to my photographic works. The themepack is available for free in the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/scenic-europe-2-download-theme">Windows Personalization Gallery</a>. It contains 12 desktop images covering locations like Budapest, Corsica, Lake Lucerne, the Isle of Skye, the Swiss Alps, Munich, Zurich or United Kingdom.
