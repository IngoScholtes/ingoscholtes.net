		<h3><a href="">Article published in EPJ Data Science</a></h3>
		  Our article <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00416-3">Bayesian inference of transition matrices from incomplete graph data with a topological prior</a> has now been published in the journal <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00416-3">EPJ Data Science</a>. In our work, we develop a Bayesian method to infer random walk transition matrices in weighted graphs, where we have access to incomplete observation on edges.

		<h3><a href="">New preprint on community detection</a></h3>
		<p>Our new preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01144">The Map Equation Goes Neural</a> has now been published on arXiv. In our work, we reformulate the the information-theoretic objective function MapEquation in a differentiable tensor form, which allows to optimize it via gradient descent,

		<h3><a href="">Paper published in Phys. Review E</a></h3>
		<p>Our latest work on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.034312">Inference of time-ordered multibody interactions</a> has been published in the journal <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.034312">Physical Review E</a>. In our work, we show how the dynamics of multivariate Markov chains can be decomposed in ensembles of time-ordered multibody interactions. We further show how we can characterize the complexity of those ensemble.
