		<h3><a href="talks.html">Invited Talk at University of Mannheim</a></h3>
		<p>Today, I was honoured to give an invited talk in the colloquium of the <a href="https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/strohmaier/">Chair of Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences</a> at the University of Mannheim. In my talk with the title <a href="">Data Science and Social Sciences: A History of Misunderstandings</a>, I give a historical and philosophical perspective on the evolution of data science and computational social science.

		  <h3><a href="talks.html">De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks</a></h3>
		  <p>In our latest work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08311">De Bruijn goes Neural: Causality-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Data on Dynamic Graphs</a>, we introduce De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNNs), a novel time-aware graph neural network architecture for time-resolved data on dynamic graphs. It accounts for temporal-topological patterns that unfold in the causal topology of dynamic graphs. A preprint is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08311">arXiv</a>.

		<h3><a href="publications.html">Paper accepted at IEEE/ACM ASONAM 2022</a></h3>
		<p>Our manuscript <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12100">Predicting Influential Higher-Order Patterns in Temporal Network Data</a> has been accepted for publication at the <a href="https://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2022/">IEEE/ACM International Conference on Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2022)</a>. In our work, we use a multi-order generative model of paths to define time-aware centralities of nodes, and use them to predict node centralities in out-of-sample data. Our work sheds light on the importance of temporal information for the ranking of nodes in complex networks.
