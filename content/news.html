		<p>Our manuscript <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12100">Predicting Influential Higher-Order Patterns in Temporal Network Data</a> has been accepted for publication at the <a href="https://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2022/">IEEE/ACM International Conference on Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2022)</a>. In our work, we use a multi-order generative model of paths to define time-aware centralities of nodes, and use them to predict node centralities in out-of-sample data. Our work sheds light on the importance of temporal information for the ranking of nodes in complex networks.

			<h3><a href="activities.html">New course: Machine Learning for Complex Networks</a></h3>
			<p>Today we are launching our new MSc course <a href="">Machine Learning for Complex Networks</a> at the Institute for Informatics of Julius-Maximilians-Universit채t W체rzburg. The course has been designed from scratch and it covers state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for graph data, including community detection and link prediction, graph representation learning and graph neural networks. The lectures are accompanied by more than 50 jupyter notebooks in which we implement modern graph learning techniques.
