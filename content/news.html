		<h3><a href="publications.html">Two papers accepted at NeurIPS!</a></h3>
		<p>I am happy to announce that two of our works were accepted for the research track of the <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/lwda24/program/invited-speaker/#c1146442">Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2024</a>, which is the premiere venue on deep learning. In our works we use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15865">time-aware graph neural networks to predict temporal centralities</a> and we show how <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01144">graph neural networks can be used to minimize the MapEquation for community detection in graphs</a>. <span class="meta">September 26, 2024</span></p>
