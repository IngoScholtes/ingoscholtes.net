		<h3><a href="talks.html">Invited Talk at Inetum AG</a></h3>
		<p>Today, I am honoured to give a talk at the user conference of Inetum AG in Zurich, Switzerland. In my talk, I give a brief introduction to machine learning. I will further show how we can apply data science and graph learning in big data on software repositories and what pitfalls await us in the analysis of massive online data sets.

		<h3><a href="talks.html">Graph Perspective on Tolkien's Legendarium</a></h3>
		<p>In our new work, we take a network perspective on character co-occurrences in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. A preprint is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07871">arXiv</a>. Our work has been accepted as a full paper at the conference <a href="https://2022.computational-humanities-research.org/">Computational Humanities Research 2022</a>, which will be held in Antwerp, Belgium in December 2022.

		  <h3><a href="talks.html">De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks</a></h3>
		  <p>In our latest work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08311">De Bruijn goes Neural: Causality-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Data on Dynamic Graphs</a>, we introduce De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNNs), a novel time-aware graph neural network architecture for time-resolved data on dynamic graphs. It accounts for temporal-topological patterns that unfold in the causal topology of dynamic graphs. A preprint is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08311">arXiv</a>.
