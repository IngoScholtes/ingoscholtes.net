		<h3><a href="talks.html">Three submissions accepted at LoG</a></h3>
		<p>We are very happy to learn that all three of our submissions to the <a href="https://logconference.org/">Learning on Graphs Conference</a> have been accepted. In our first full paper submission, we introduce a novel information-theoretic pproach to calculate node similarities in graphs based on the MapEquation. In a second full paper submission, we develop Causality-Aware De Bruijn-Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Data. Finally, in an extended abstract we present an information-theoretic approach to detect causal time scales in temporal networks.
