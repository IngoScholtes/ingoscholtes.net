		<h3><a href="publications.html">New preprint on inference of higher-order interactions</a></h3>
		<p>We have released a preprint of our latest work<a href="publications.html">Inference of time-ordered multibody interactions</a>. In this work, we propose a method that can use data on multivariate Markov chains to decompose the underlying interactions into ensembles of time-ordered multibody relationships.

		<h3><a href="publications.html">Paper accepted at ICSE 2022</a></h3>
		<p>Our work <a href="publications.html">Big Data = Big Insights? Operationalizing Brooks’ Law in a Massive GitHub Data Set</a> was accepted for the technical track of the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022">44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</a>. In our paper, we highlight methodological and epistemological challenges in the analysis of team productivity in massive repository data. Our study has been collaboratively conducted with researchers from ETH Zürich.
