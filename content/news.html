		<h3><a href="">Keynote on Data Science and Social Sciences</a></h3>
		<p>Tomorrow, I am honored to give the opening keynote <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/physik/didaktik-physik/gfd-tagung-2020/programm-und-call/index.html">Data Science and Social Sciences - A History of Misunderstandings</a> at the annual convention of the German Society of Didactics (GFD) held (virtually) at the University of Regensburg. In my talk, I will discuss the epistemological history of data science and empirical social sciences, which are a source of frequent misunderstandings between the disciplines.
