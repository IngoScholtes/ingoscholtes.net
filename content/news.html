		<h3><a href="talks.html">Keynote on Higher-Order Network Science</a></h3>
		<p>Today I am honoured to give a keynote talk on <a href="talks.html">Higher-Order Network Science: From Theoretical Foundations to Machine Learning</a> at the NetSci 2021 Satellite Workshop on <a href="https://hons-web.github.io/online/">Higher-Order Models in Network Science (HONS 2021)</a>. In my talk, I will give a historical perspective on network science and higher-order models and I will outline three open challenges that limit the impact of higher-order models in practice.

		<h3><a href="">Five open positions at my Chair</a></h3>
		<p>I currently have five fully-funded positions available at my Chair: Three positions are for PhD students, who are expected to work on topics like graph learning, network analysis, and computational social science. Two positions are for postdocs/senior researchers with an interest in network science, human-AI collaboration, or large-scale data processing. Please contact me via E-Mail in case you are interested.

		<h3><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09928-2">New work published in Empirical Software Engineering</a></h3>
		<p>We are happy to announce that today our latest work studying causal mechanism behind the Ringelmann effect in software development teams has been published in the journal <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10664">Empirical Software Engineering</a>. In our <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09928-2">article</a>, we find strong evidence for the hypothesis that the need to edit code previously written by other developers negatively affects developer productivity. We further show how our python package <a href="https://github.com/gotec/git2net">git2net</a> can be used to perform large-scale analysis of co-editing networks.
