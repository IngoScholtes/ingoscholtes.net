	<h3><a href="publications">Three submissions accepted at LoG 2025</a></h3>
	<p>We are happy to share the news that three submissions from our group were accepted at the <a href="https://logconference.org/">Fourth Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2025)</a>. In two proceedings submissions, we develop a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09052">new method to compare graph partitions</a> and study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687">untrained message passing layers for link prediction</a>. In an extended abstract, we further present our recent work on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24438">expressive power of temporal GNNs</a>.
