		<h3><a href="publications.html">Paper accepted at WWW 2022</a></h3>
		<p>What is the Markov order of paths in a network? In our latest work, which has been accepted for publication at The Web Conference (WWW'22), we use Bayesian inference and model selection to address this important question in the modelling of time series data on networks. A preprint is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02861">arXiv</a>.

		<h3><a href="">What makes teams successful?</a></h3>
		<p>On January 14th, I will give a talk in the AI Talks @ JMU series. The talk with the title <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/caidas/talks/ai-talks-jmu-2022/#c889374">What makes teams successful? Insights from Repository Mining, Network Science, and Empirical Software Engineering</a> addresses the question how we can use massive data on software repositories to gain insights into collaborative software engineering.
