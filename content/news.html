		<h3><a href="talks.html">Three submissions accepted at LoG</a></h3>
		<p>We are very happy to learn that all three of our submissions to the <a href="https://logconference.org/">Learning on Graphs Conference</a> have been accepted. In our first full paper submission, we introduce a novel information-theoretic pproach to calculate node similarities in graphs based on the MapEquation. In a second full paper submission, we develop Causality-Aware De Bruijn-Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Data. Finally, in an extended abstract we present an information-theoretic approach to detect causal time scales in temporal networks.

		<h3><a href="talks.html">Talk at Tolkien Society in Zurich</a></h3>
		<p>Today, I am honoured to give an invited talk at the meeting of the Zurich chapter of the German and Swiss Tolkien Society. In a first part, I will show how we can use natural language processing and graph learning technique to quantitatively analyse Tolkien's legendarium. In a second part, I will further present my long-term photography project <a href="https://www.ingoscholtes.photo/projects/me.html">Photographing Middle-Earth</a>, which I recently presented in an article published by the Tolkien Society in Oxford.
