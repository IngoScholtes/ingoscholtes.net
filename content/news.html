		<h3><a href="publications.html">Paper accepted at ICSE 2022</a></h3>
		<p>Our work <a href="publications.html">Big Data = Big Insights? Operationalizing Brooks’ Law in a Massive GitHub Data Set</a> was accepted for the technical track of the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022">44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</a>. In our paper, we highlight methodological and epistemological challenges in the analysis of team productivity in massive repository data. Our study has been collaboratively conducted with researchers from ETH Zürich.
